/**
 * @description Given the timestamp at which the request was initiated,
 * figure out how long the user should wait to hit their 3rd party
 * given their previous requests stored in redis.
 * 
 * First we load the project's config and "requests" (list of prior request timestamps).
 * Then we remove all prior request timestamps which are outside the relevant timeframe from the requests array.
 * If, after this, we have fewer requests than are allowed per time limit, we can just return a waitTime of 0.
 * 
 * If not, then we find out how long we will have to wait in order to be able to add
 *      another request timestamp while being inside the callLimit, and return that.
 * 
 * @param requestTS - Timestamp denoting when the request was initiated from the client.
